            <h1>Questions About the Course (CSS)</h1>
            <h2>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h1>
            <p>The reviews and lessons greatly aided towards my learning about the implementation of CSS such as the Box Model, learning how to integrate colors to my content in different ways, how to display and position elements, which we learned more thoroughly using Bootstrap and the Grid system. Typography has given me ways to create text fonts that create distinct and unique designs in a website. Overall, the majority of the content was able to be understood and replicated with slight push backs in time.</p>

        <h2 class="left">What would you change about the course?</h2>
        <p class="left2">The course could probably include more modernized utilizations of CSS. Changes in the websites that are used in assignments or as examples, so that we could see or make in depth analyses for modern websites. For example, how CSS can function when used with simple codes of JavaScript aside from HTML.</p>
        <h2 class="middle">Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course? </h2>
        <p class="middle2">The more complex methods such as the Grid system and Bootstrap were new concepts, so it took time to learn about how you can correctly define the elements ordering with the changing of proportions so that it works. Learning color through different syntax and changing its values was fair to learn. The Box Model became easier to learn throughout the course, and the same goes for displaying and positioning too.</p>
        <h2 class="right">What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h2>
        <p class="right2">Concepts that were new to me are the Bootstrap implementations, the color types such as RGBA, HSL, and HSLA and its values, and a more in-depth way of using positioning, how we can control the vertical and horizontal flow of blocks. The new content that I learned from the Boxel Model is knowing the difference between inline and block elements, and sizing boxes using a content box method instead of a border-box, vice versa. For the concepts that I knew from HTML class, it was the first assignments about using Github, Git, and Visual Code Studio. I have learned the majority of the box model, and how elements can be shifted in all directions by changing the values of the content, padding, border, and the margin. The way I used colors were more bare-bone, knowing how to change colors, but not know how to edit their opacity and such.</p>
